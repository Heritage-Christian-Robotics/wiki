## What is this?

You're currently looking at the wiki to the Heritage Christian Robotics Organization. I (Caleb Buening, alumni from 2023) wanted to assembled a knowledge base for any Heritage student (or non Heritage student) who wanted to take some of the cool creations from past years and iterate on them.

Included in this repository are collections of code that I have gathered from past Heritage teams over the years. In this wiki are links and other pieces of information that I or others have found useful over the years. Hopefully it will help you on your journey to building a better robot.

Good luck.
