# wiki

## What is this?

You're currently looking at the wiki to the Heritage Christian Robotics Organization. I (Caleb Buening, alumni from 2023) wanted to assembled a knowledge base for any Heritage student (or non Heritage student) who wanted to take some of the cool creations from past years and iterate on them.

Included in this repository are collections of code that I have gathered from past Heritage teams over the years. In this wiki are links and other pieces of information that I or others have found useful over the years. Hopefully it will help you on your journey to building a better robot.

## Navigating the repositories

Included in the organization are public and private repos. Whether or not each repo is public or private is entirely up to the creators of the project, but I recommend keeping them private then releasing them as public after the year is over. Firstly, sharing knowledge betters all of Vex, it's just a good thing to do. Secondly, no one is going to look at your code anyways. They're either smart enough that they think their code is better or are new enough that they won't be able to make much use out of your code anyways.

I am considering going through some of my older code and adding commentaries to it. If so, I will tag the final version -- the state the code was in on the last day of worlds -- with the term `final`. Then, I'll update the newest version of the code to have proper formatting and commentary, to make it more useful to future readers. We'll see if I actually get that done.

--------------

In highschool I aimed to innovate; Joey Curnutt and I created one of the first AI-powered autons in Vex (see 6210K in 2021 and 2022), and had an incredibly good time doing it. Hopefully that code and these resources are useful and allow you guys to not just win at competitions, but create something cool, that no one has even seen before.

Good luck.
